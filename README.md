# Overview
This repository contains all the code for the final project for the Localization course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.


In this project a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++ is implemented to successfully localize the vehicle. The particle filter is given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter also gets observation and control data.

## Running the Code
To run the code together with the kidnapped vehicle simulator, use the scripts provided at the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh
